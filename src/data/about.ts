/**
 * Highlight configuration for the About section.
 * 
 * - The object keys represent the paragraph index.
 * - `alwaysActiveIndexes` is an array of word positions (zero-based) within the paragraph that should always remain highlighted, regardless of scroll position.
 * - `highlightWord` is a specific word (cleaned and case-insensitive) within the paragraph that should receive a custom CSS class (e.g., "gradient-text").
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * {
 *   0: { alwaysActiveIndexes: [0, 1, 2] }, // Always highlight the first three words of paragraph 0
 *   4: { highlightWord: 'remarkable' }    // Apply special CSS to the word 'remarkable' in paragraph 4
 * }
 * 
 * Notes:
 * - Word positions start at 0 and should be counted after splitting the paragraph by spaces.
 * - The highlightWord is automatically cleaned (accents and punctuation removed, and compared in lowercase).
 * - You can combine both `alwaysActiveIndexes` and `highlightWord` in the same paragraph if needed.
